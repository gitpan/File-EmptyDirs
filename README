File::EmptyDirs  - Find all empty directories in a path and remove recursively.
===============================================================================

Ever end up with some miscellaneous empty directories in a messy filesystem and
you just want to clean up all empty dirs?

For example.. If you have..

   /home/myself/tp/this/nada

And the only thing in this is 'nada', and 'nada' does not contain anything, you'd like
to remove both of those. This is what to use.

Nothing exported by default.

The operation  is self exclusive, that is, if you pass dir /home/myself, it will not
delete /home/myself if it is an empty dir.
